====  Layer CRS

A Layer CRS is a horizontal coordinate reference system for the
geographic information that serves as the source for a map. A WMS must
support at least one CRS, and maps from multiple servers may be overlaid
only if all the selected servers support at least one CRS in common.

::
*_Requirement 6: A DGIWG WMS server shall support the following coordinate
reference systems:_*
* CRS:84 WGS84 geographic longitude, then latitude, expressed in decimal degrees
* EPSG:4326 WGS84 geographic latitude, then longitude, expressed in decimal degrees
* EPSG:3395 World Mercator projection

::
*_Among the following Coordinate Reference Systems, the service shall
support all those which validity zone overlaps data published by the
service:_*
* UTM projections over WGS84 (north zones)…  EPSG:32601 to EPSG:32660  
* UTM projections over WGS84 (south zones)…  EPSG:32701 to EPSG:32760  
* UPS projection over WGS84 (north zone)…  EPSG:32661  
* UPS projection over WGS84 (south zone)…  EPSG:32761

Implementation guidance:

*NOTE:* Normative Reference 1, Section 7.2.4.6.6 states that: "Every
named Layer shall have exactly one <EX_GeographicBoundingBox> element
that is either stated explicitly or inherited from a parent Layer”.
This is unclear in the base standard. Chapter 7.2.4.6.8 BoundingBox in
the base standard states that: The <EX_GeographicBoundingBox> element
(7.2.4.6.6) is conceptually similar to a BoundingBox in which the
attribute CRS="CRS:84" is implicit. However, <EX_GeographicBoundingBox>
shall not be used as a substitute for <BoundingBox CRS="CRS:84">. If the
server wishes to provide bounding box information in the CRS:84 CRS,
then a separate BoundingBox element explicitly naming CRS:84 shall be
included in the service metadata.
This means that Ex_GeographicBoundingBox within a DGIWG server shall
always be in CRS="CRS:84". 

Some geographic information may be available at other dimensions like
for instance elevation or time (3D / 4D). For example, in the case of
elevation, atmospheric information like ozone concentrations, may be
available at different altitudes. Similarly, geographic information may
be available at multiple times, like hourly tidal information.

*NOTE:* Appropriate vertical and temporal coordinate systems have to
be defined in the context of the particular application.
The verticalCRSid “CRS:88” refers to the vertical CRS defined in B.6
(elevation in meters in the North American Vertical Datum 1988). The
unitSymbol “m” would be used. See Normative Reference 1, Annex C
“Handling multi-dimensional data” for more information.
