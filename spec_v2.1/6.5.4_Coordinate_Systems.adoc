=== Coordinate Systems

The Web Map Service standard uses two principal classes of Coordinate Systems: a *Map CS* applicable to the map portrayal generated by the WMS, and a *Layer CRS* for a Bounding Box applied to the source data. During a portrayal operation, a WMS converts or transforms geographic information from a Layer CRS into a Map CS. In addition, a Layer may have an associated vertical, temporal or other coordinate system.
