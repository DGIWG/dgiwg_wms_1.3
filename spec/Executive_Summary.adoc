=  Executive Summary

This document defines specific DGIWG requirements, recommendations and guidelines for implementations of the ISO / OGC Web Map Service standard which is based on ISO 19128:2005 Web Map Server Interface / OpenGIS Web Map Server Implementation Specification 1.3.0.

ISO 19128: 2005 defines a Web Map Service as:

_"A Web Map Service (WMS) produces maps of spatially referenced data dynamically from geographic information. This International Standard defines a “map” to be a portrayal of geographic information as a digital image file suitable for display on a computer screen. A map is not the data itself. WMS-produced maps are generally rendered in a pictorial format such as PNG, GIF or JPEG, or occasionally as vector-based graphical elements in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer Graphics Metafile (WebCGM) formats."_

Previous versions of the WMS standard have not been considered in this profile.

The WMS Interface offers 3 Operations:

* *GetCapabilities* (mandatory): Allows for obtaining Service Metadata
* *GetMap* (mandatory): Returns a map
* *GetFeatureInfo* (optional): Provides additional information about features in the pictures of maps that were returned by previous GetMap requests  

The WMS Implementation Specification defines two conformance classes, “Basic WMS” and “Queryable WMS”. The Basic WMS supports the mandatory GetCapabilities and GetMap operations (requests and responses) whereas the Queryable WMS supports all Basic WMS operations and the GetFeatureInfo operation. The DGIWG WMS profile mandates the implementation of the *Queryable WMS*.

Software implementations that claim to be conformant with the DGIWG WMS profile *shall* support *all mandatory* operations, parameters and elements of the base standard, as well as the specifically defined requirements in this document.

The DGIWG WMS profile *references* the different operations and parameters of *the base standard* and subsequently *defines specific DGIWG requirements* and *recommendations* for software implementations to foster *interoperability* and use in the *military domain*.
