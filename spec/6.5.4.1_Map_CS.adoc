A Map CS is a coordinate reference system for a map produced by a WMS. A
WMS map is a rectangular grid of pixels displayed on a computer screen
(or a digital file that could be so displayed). The Map CS has a
horizontal axis denoted i, and a vertical axis denoted j. i and j shall
have only nonnegative integer values. The origin (i,j) =(0,0) is the
pixel in the upper left corner of the map; i increases to the right and
j increases downward.
